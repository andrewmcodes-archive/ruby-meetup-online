              Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with

              that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily
              banning the offender from the community. In less urgent
              situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and
              mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with
              the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide
              upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will
              be considered final.

              or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that
              doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general
              public. We will not name harassment victims without their
              affirmative consent.

              Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
              comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing

              appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and
              identification of the participant as a harasser to other members.
              At the discretion of the admins, or by request, one or more of the
              parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to
              avoid similar situations in the future.
